Re-usable Linux Scripts
#The scripts you find here, are generic ones that can be applied on all the supported servers.
#hese script(s) have all the steps/tasks for unix/linux/solaris servers as per industry best practices, which may not be suitable for your requirement.
#Please run this as ‘root’ to get expected output.
#So we suggest to go through the script(s) before you run and comment the tasks/steps, based on your business requirement please edit/delete commands.
